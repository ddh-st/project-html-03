                <p>The sitcom That '70s Show aired on Fox for eight seasons from 1998 to 2006, centering around the lives of teenagers from 1976 to 1979. The show garnered additional popularity after its conclusion due to its availability on Netflix, before leaving the platform in September 2020.</p>
                <p>In October 2021, Netflix announced a spin-off of the series, titled That '90s Show, with Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp reprising their roles as Red and Kitty Forman, respectively. It is produced by The Carsey-Werner Company, with Gregg Mettler serving as showrunner and Bonnie Turner, Terry Turner, their daughter Lindsay Turner, Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner, Smith and Rupp as executive producers.</p>
                <p>Ten episodes were ordered, with the series taking on a multi-cam format like the original. The show was filmed in front of a live studio audience at Sunset Bronson Studios in Los Angeles between February 7 and July 21, 2022.</p>
                <p>In February 2022, Callie Haverda, Ashley Aufderheide, Mace Coronel, Maxwell Acee Donovan, Reyn Doi and Sam Morelos joined the cast as series regulars. It was also reported that Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, and Wilmer Valderrama would appear in recurring roles. It was expected that Danny Masterson would not appear due to accusations made against him, and a pending criminal trial at that time; Masterson ultimately did not appear and his character of Steven Hyde was simply not mentioned on the series. Two supporting characters from the original series, Laurie Forman and Midge Pinciotti, also did not appear due to the deaths of their respective actresses (Lisa Robin Kelly and Tanya Roberts)[dubious – discuss]. Production commenced February 6. On April 30, 2022, it was announced that Grace, Prepon, Kunis, Kutcher, and Valderrama would all return for guest appearances. On February 3, 2023, Netflix renewed the series for a 16-episode second season.</p>
